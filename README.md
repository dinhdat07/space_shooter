## Features
Our game offers a variety of features that make it engaging and fun to play:

- **Boss System**: In Space Shooter, each boss boasts unique skill effects and a menacing appearance. A boss appears every time the player scores 20 points. As the game progresses, bosses become increasingly challenging to defeat, providing an engaging experience for even the most seasoned gamers.
Currently, the Boss system features 3 forms:

1. **Oblivion Overlord**: Fires bullets that inflict substantial damage.

2. **Nebula Nemesis**: Shoots bullets with the ability to stun, immobilizing the player.

3. **Galactic Gorgon**: Launches bullets that reduce the player's health to 1 over a certain period. During this time, if the player is hit by another bullet, they will lose.

- **Power-ups**: Throughout the game, players can collect power-ups that enhance their spaceship's abilities. These power-ups can give you an edge in combat, making it easier to defeat enemies and progress through the game.
Space Shooter currently offers two power-ups:
1. **Increased Energy**: Players will fire 3 bullets simultaneously instead of a single bullet.
2. **Health Restore**: Players will recover 4 health points.

- **High Score and Hero System**:
The game features a score system where players earn points for each enemy they defeat. Strive to surpass your previous scores to unlock new galactic warriors.
Space Shooter currently features 5 warriors:

1. **Galaxy Guardian**: The initial hero (Damage: 1, Fire rate: 1)
